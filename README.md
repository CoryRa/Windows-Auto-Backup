Here's what the script does:

Define the source directories or files you want to backup in the source_paths list.
Define the destination directory on the external storage device in the destination_path variable.
Define the path for the log file in the log_file variable.
The script creates the backup directory if it doesn't exist.
It logs the backup process including the start time, source paths, destination paths, and any errors encountered during the backup process.


You can schedule this script to run automatically using Task Scheduler in Windows. Set it to run at a convenient time, such as daily or weekly, to ensure regular backups of your important files and directories.
