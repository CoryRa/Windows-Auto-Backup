Here's what the script does:

Define the source directories you want to backup in the source_paths list.
Define the destination path, which could be a different drive, as noted in the file, or on the same drive letter.
Define the path for the log file in the log_file variable. Example "X:\\Test\backup_log.txt"
The script creates the backup directory if it doesn't exist.
It logs the backup process including the start time, source paths, destination paths, and any errors encountered during the backup process.


You can schedule this script to run automatically using Task Scheduler in Windows. Set it to run at a convenient time, such as daily or weekly, to ensure regular backups of your important files and directories.
